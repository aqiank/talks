* Algorithm test

.play algorithm.go

* First prototype
.html first_prototype.html

* First prototype
demo (software)

* First prototype

- Go
	receives and encrypt tweets, simulates Bombe, broadcast Bombe state

- Processing
	listen to Go and controls Arduino

- Web (HTML5 + WebGL)
	renders the Bombe

* First prototype

Disadvantages:

- Fixed serial port names
	String T1 = "/dev/ttyACM5";

- Many programs to run (Go, Processing, browser)

- Unplug while program is running? Exception!

* Second prototype
.html second_prototype.html

* Second prototype
- Web (Electron, React, node-serialport)
	Receive and encrypt tweets, simulates Bombe, controls Arduino, no need to broadcast
	
* Second prototype

Advantages:

- API for connect/disconnect serial port event

- Helps with wiring and flashing many Arduinos

- Only one program to run

* Second prototype
